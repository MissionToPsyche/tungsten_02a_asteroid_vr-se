 Left and right images of the Sojourner rover perched atop Wedge rock during Sol 47. Sojourner has safely traversed off of Wedge and is now the vicinity of Shark rock where it will perform additional APXS measurements. In these images the vantage point of the IMP camera provides a view looking into the throat of the APXS. The APXS is the round object in the center of the front surface of the rover.
