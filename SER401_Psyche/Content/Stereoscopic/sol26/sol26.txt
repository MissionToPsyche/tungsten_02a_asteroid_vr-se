This stereo pair of images were taken by the rover front cameras on Sol 26. The rover was facing towards the south southeast and was located 5 meters from the Pathfinder lander. It shows a rock-strewn surface between the rover and Mermaid "dune." Mermaid, the dark, horizontal area seen betwen rocks near the horizon, is the target for the next APXS measurement. Some of the rocks in the very near field show features attributed to wind erosion. The small rock on the left shows "flutes" (streamlined depressions) and the slighly larger rock on the right shows features that appear to point up-wind (wind coming from the left rear of the rover).
