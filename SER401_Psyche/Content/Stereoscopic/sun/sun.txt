This pair of images, made by the S-054 X-ray Spectrographic Telescope on-board the US spacestation Skylab, shows the Sun's appearance in the combined X-ray wavebands 2-32 and 44-54Ã…. The bright material seen in the images is hot, rarefied gas of the Sun's outer atmosphere (the corona), glowing because of its high temperature of a million degrees Kelvin (or more). The forms of the gas clouds are determined by magnetic fields, which play a still mysterious role in heating the clouds to such high temperatures, and sometimes cause the clouds to explode, emitting intense bursts of harmful radiations throughout the solar system. The effects of the radiations on the terrestrial environment are subjects of great interest as likely factors in climate change and as hazards to astronauts and spacecraft. Forecasting of solar flares would be a great advance, and thus the dynamics of these clouds is of keen interest. The image pair represents a step towards better investigation of the physics of solar activity by obtaining more three-dimensional information about the coronal structures. In the time between the images (about 14 hours) the Sun's rotation provides a parallax via its rotation. The images have been registered and placed so that the viewer can train the left eye at the left image and right eye at the right image, obtaining a quasi- stereoscopic view, as if one had eyes separated by one tenth the distance from Earth to the Sun. Much of the Sun's coronal structure was stable during this time, so depth can be perceived
